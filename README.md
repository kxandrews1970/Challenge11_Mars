# Challenge11_Mars
Part1 scraping was great, i was able to do it without much assistance at all. So much so, i redid it 3 times! Not sure how i lost the changes (locally).  Part2 was a little more difficult for me, so I looked at[ ](https://github.com/pbhan710/mars-web-scraping-challenge) for inspiration.  As you can tell, graphing and I have a ways to go.  Scraping was a concept that did not make much sense as sql did.  Sql, i am used to so it was easier to grasp.  No-sql, I can understand a little since concepts are similar.  It was nice to see in real-time web scraping, by doing this challenge it started to make more sense for me.  In the end, I have a greater understanding than I did in the class exercises.  Personally, I see more usefulness in sql (again, i used it often at previous job).  Current job, I am trying to gain access to the company's Oracle db to get reports generated that are now being done manually.  Key is I know how to do it. (at least in sql)  So one key element learnt in class that I wanted.  

Honestly, I now want to learn more python.  There are free courses I will start after this bootcamp ends.  I have used Visual Source Code for powershell scripting previously.  I really appreciate the course being done in VSC, I am learning a few tips/tricks in it that I haven't used before in it.  Now if I can parlay that into a new job which is the main goal of taking the course...
